# Fisher

Simple implementation of Fisher algorithm 

Provided two sample files, positive.txt and negative.txt, if you want to change the default input file, you can use the following command:

--pos positive_file_name

--neg negative_file_name

 The default test sample data used is neg_array[1] , and it is the n-dimensional data in the second line of the negative file , if you want to change the defaule test sample data , you can use the following command:

--sample n(or p),index

 n or p means negative_file or positive_file. 

Of course , you can change the test set to the data file you need , but you have to change the code slightly.

Finally , look forward to any of you comments or suggestions for feedback.
